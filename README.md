A program that keeps track of your progress trough a series of files trough an excel-sheet. Designed specifically for video-files. Swedish interface. 

The program automatically creates a new excel-file when launched for the first time in a folder with files. The program guesses the target filetype but needs confirmation from the user.
After the initial setup the program runs trough all files of the filetype until all are played.
